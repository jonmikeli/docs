# IoT simulators with Elgato Stream Deck

This project go a bit further when it comes to the use of the already implemented set of tools and simulators.

Having such tools is great. However, from the practical perspective, some projects or contexts might require:
 - using different configurations of the tools
 - have access to them in a fast and easy way

Instead of building another application being used as hub for all the tools, using a stream deck might be a good alternative.

This article describes how to use an Elgato Stream Deck to control the IoT simulators.

Have fun ;).

## Prerequisites

- Elgato Stream Deck
- Elgato Stream Deck software installed
- Elgato mobile application (optional)
- Docker installed


## Configuration

The idea here is to use a stream deck to control different IoT simulators answering to different contexts:
 - different configurations
 - different projects

The content of the article will be based on the containerized version of the IoT Simulator (multidevice).
If you need more details, you can find them [here](../tools/simulators/iot-simulator-multi-device-container.md).

When it comes to stream decks, Elgato offers very popular products. They even include a mobile application.
The article describes how to use physical Elgato Stream Deck and also, the mobile application.

This way, you can imagine additional alternatives to your use cases.


### Stream Deck

### Mobile application

> [!NOTE]
>
> Be sure that Elgato Stream Deck software is installed on your computer and that the mobile application is also installed on your mobile device.
