# IoT simulators with Elgato Stream Deck

This project go a bit further when it comes to the use of the already implemented set of tools and simulators.

Having such tools is great. However, from the practical perspective, some projects or contexts might require:
 - using different configurations of the tools
 - have access to them in a fast and easy way

Instead of building another application being used as hub for all the tools, using a stream deck might be a good alternative.

This article describes how to use an Elgato Stream Deck to control the IoT simulators.

Have fun ;).
