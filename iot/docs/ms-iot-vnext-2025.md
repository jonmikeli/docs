# Microsoft, IoT, what is going on?

Dotnet conf 2025 and Microsoft Ignite 2025 have just finished with valuable information.
AI is omnipresent with very interesting topics like:
 - the IQ family of products and solutions
 - Microsoft Agent Framework
 - Azure AI Foundry as a centric point to create AI ready solutions (quite impressive how productive it is becoming to create AI-ready or agentic oriented solutions)

Besides this inevitable AI content, .NET 10 comes also with great improvements with:
 - Aspire, truly impressive
 - performance improvements
 - Blazor 10
 - EF10
 - security improvements
 - etc

 All this has been great.
 But there is something more, quite significant too: the new features and roadmap in IoT, specially about Azure IoT Hub.
 It has taken some time but seeing new features, ADR integration, etc is truly great news for the IoT community.
