# Microsoft, IoT, what is going on?

The MVP Summit 2024 has just finished with valuable information and clarification about Microsoft's vision on different topics.
Obviously, IoT was one of the topics.
This post will not reveal any content (NDA). However, competitors strategies, context, Microsoft's silence or very descrete manifestations, or the last message about IoT Central published by error have probably contributed to confusion, assumptions, shortcuts and everything but contrastable information.

So, it is maybe a good time to state a few messages clearly from an independent perspective, and clarify what is going on and what to expect.
At some point, Microsoft should explain itself what its vision is.
I make a step forward as an external and independent thoughts.

## Commitment

MVP Summit is an event organized by Microsoft to share with MVPs and RDs all around the world, their vision in the extense catalog of services and products. During many days, Product Managers, Engineers, Managers, VP share valuable content of current works and how Microsoft is shaping the future.
The event also gives the opportunity to the attendees to have very direct conversations with Microsoft.

After many sessions and more than 10 dedicated events in very small groups about IoT and related topics, there is no doubt that Microsoft is still investing seriously in IoT. The commitment is clear and so the mobilization of resources.
As mentioned initially, this post will not mention any specific content but this might perceived has an honest and independent message of what the IoT MVP have witnessed.

## What to expect

## Bottom line
