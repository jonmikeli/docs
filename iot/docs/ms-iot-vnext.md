# Microsoft, IoT, what is going on?

The MVP Summit 2024 has just finished with valuable information and clarification about Microsoft's vision on different topics.
Obviously, IoT was one of the topics.
This post will not reveal any content (NDA). However, competitors strategies, context, Microsoft's silence or very descrete manifestations, or the last message about IoT Central published by error have probably contributed to confusion, assumptions, shortcuts and everything but contrastable information.

So, it is maybe a good time to state a few messages clearly from an independent perspective, and clarify what is going on and what to expect.
At some point, Microsoft should explain itself what its vision is.
I make a step forward as an external and independent thoughts.

## Strategy

## Commitment

## What to expect

## Bottom line
