# IoT Tools
This section enumerates some of the tools that I have been building for IoT and Azure (PaaS) solutions. The spirit of the whole set of tools is to:
 - ease developers life
 - accelerate development
 - increase quality
 - absorb a certain level of complexity
 - industrialize and streamline the development process


## Accelerators
The accelerators have for purpose to increase the productivity of specific tasks. For now, accelerators are mainly technical even though they provide different types of value.

### IoT Accelerator
The IoT Accelerator takes in charge the deployment of the infrastructure or the platform components of an IoT Solution. Inherently, the produced content remains quite technical but this is what is expected at this level.

This tool is not available for a public use now.
After some unappropriated uses, it has been retired from public access. A commercial version is being considered instead.

### Others


## Simulators
Simulators might represent different types of tools. So, it is probably useful to state what the simulators are in this case.

The simulators are applications being able to reproduce most of the IoT flows and interactions (D2C and C2D).
These simulators do not include rich data simulation features. Instead, they contain very simple components to randomize data from the technical perspective.

The mentioned simulators are delivered through two formats
    - containerized application
    - standalone application (mobile application)
  
### Containerized
The containerized simulator is the initial and default version of the simulator. It is the one which offers the most possibilities. It is more suitable for a set of simulated devices in a park of devices.


### Mobile app
