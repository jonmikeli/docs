# .NET 8 YARP Template

This Visual Studio solution template is the result of different works on how to help developers when it comes to developing distributed applications (backend). It is quite common to implement a gateway (or many) in such solutions. This extensions helps in that task and provides a starting point to implement a gateway using YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy).

The created template implements a quite simplistic but complete (and operational) solution.
It includes common settings and a configuration by default that can be updated afterwards.

The "Why" of this extension is to simplify developers' lives and help them to find easy ways to implement basic features, with patterns and good practices, without having to spend a lot of time looking for "how tos". The extension absorbs that work and offers it to developers.

IDEs come with full of technical templates. However, I thought it could be meaningful to create value with deeper approaches and help developers in their daily work.

Choices are based on experiences that might be biased and as a result, the template might have an opinionated perspective.
Feel free to provide feedback and use the template at will.


### YARP

YARP is a reverse proxy, used in many Microsoft products, that allows to create a gateway to expose multiple services through a single access endpoint. It is a great solution to create a gateway for a microservices architectures.

It includes features like:
 - Swagger UI
 - Health checks
 - Routing
 - Request Logging
 - Rate limiting
 - Caching
 - Compression
 - Request and response transformations
 - Request and response tracing
 - Protocol translation
 - Load balancing
 - etc
