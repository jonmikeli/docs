# .NET 8 Thoughts and Reflections

.NET 8 Improvements
Performances
Updated libraries and dependencies
API features (WebAPI, CoreWCf, gRPC)
EF8
Blazor 8
MAUI 8
Traces, logging, and debugging

General development experience (mainly for distributed applications)
Special mention to Aspire

And without talking about all the Azure improvements (too long be exhaustive and precise), AI services, GitHub and Azure DevOps, etc.

Isn't it a great time to be a .NET developer?
Not only talking about the technology itself, but also the community and the ecosystem ... and also business.
From the business perspective, isn't .NET a great technical stack to invest in?
