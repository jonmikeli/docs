# .NET 8 Thoughts and Reflections
# TODO

.NET has been around for a while, going through different phases and transformations.
We could even say quite fairly that it has been gone through very deep transformations.

Inherently, developers, architects and companies might have experienced different feelings and thoughts about .NET.

What is the state of .NET today?

# .NET 8

.NET 8 is the current version of .NET.
It is now a cross platform framework. In the past, the .NET Framework was tightly linked to Windows but that has changed.
Actually, a lot of things have changed. .NET covers now a lot of more areas, more efficiently and better.

So, I would dare to invite those who keep the .NET Framework image in their minds, to just give a try to the "other" .NET and assess again if it could be a good choice to them.


# An excerpt of the changes/improvements in .NET 8

.NET 8 is a cross-platform framework that covers different scenarios, such as:
 - Web development (special mention to Blazor, the WASM framework that allows to build web applications with C#)
 - native and cross-platform mobile development (MAUI)
 - Desktop development (WPF, UWP, WinUI, MAUI) (not mentioning WinForms even though it seems still quite used)
 - Cloud development (APIs, Azure Functions, event/messages driven applications, data consuming applications, etc)
 - Machine learning
 - Game development
 - IoT development (IoT Operations, and IoT Solutions at cloud level)
 - API development (WebAPIs, minimal APIs, CoreWCF, gRPC, etc)
 - Distributed applications (Aspire, Dapr, etc)
 - C# itself
 - compilation
 - containerization and optimized containers
 - etc


# Other important/interesting Aspects to reconsider about .NET 8

## Cross-platform

.NET is cross-platform. It is not only cross-platform, but also cross-architecture (x86, x64, ARM, etc).

> NOTE
> 
> There are parts of .NET like the UI related content where the cross-platform support is limited.

## Open source

Yes, .NET is opens source. This still surprises some people.

## Community

Yes, there is an important community around .NET contributing and enriching with rich content, libraries, tools, etc.

## Tooling

Tooling around .NET is probably among the best in the industry.
There are proprietary IDEs like Visual Studio, Rider, etc.

There are also free IDEs like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio Community, etc.

The same IDE is used for the different types of development.

Visual Studio, my personal choice for most of the tasks, is truly a great IDE:
 - the developer experience is quite good (IntelliSense, tools, extensions, performance analyzers, thread analyzers, etc)
 - the debugging experience is unique.
 - seamless integration with Azure, GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc (Git integration could be better though)
 

## Learning curve

.NET documentation and references are (or were) sometimes a mess.
The Learn Team is working to change this and it is becoming better.

There are a lot of free resources to start learning .NET and even, go deeper in specific topics.
There are also very good paid trainings from community members (ex: [https://dometrain.com](dometrain.com) from Nick Chapsas) or proffesionnal training services.

The features of .NET, how they have been implemented, their approach and how they are exposed to be used contains the learning effort to be done.

All these together builds a quite condensed learning curve.


## Enterprise/architectural/developer needs

Technical features and usability are one thing, but architectural/developer needs at enterprise level are another thing.
From this perspective, .NET and its whole ecosystem offer a good choice thanks to:
 - the maturity level
 - clear roadmaps (even though we all hate the speed of changes sometimes) guaranteed by a company like Microsoft
 - continuous improvements
 - reliability and stability
 - proprietary tooling that clearly improves the developer experience (coding, testing, efficiency, etc)
 - security patches and improvements
 - constant performance improvements
 - efficient support (different levels of support depending on the needs)
 - projection in time (long term support)
 - migration tools, guidance and support
 
 From the business perspective, .NET is good for the present and also for the future.


## Ecosystem

The size of the ecosystem is hard to assess. There are probably other ecosystems larger in volume.
This said, the .NET ecosystem is quite rich in terms of variety and volume (rich enough at least to avoid the closeness feeling).

That ecosystem relies on:
 - third editors
 - private companies
 - community
 - contributors (MVPs, RDs, other community members, etc)


## Performances

## EF8



## Blazor 8



## API developement



## MAUI 8



## Traces, logging, and debugging

General development experience (mainly for distributed applications)
Special mention to Aspire

And without talking about all the Azure improvements (too long be exhaustive and precise), AI services, GitHub and Azure DevOps, etc.

Isn't it a great time to be a .NET developer?
Not only talking about the technology itself, but also the community and the ecosystem ... and also business.
From the business perspective, isn't .NET a great technical stack to invest in?


.NET 8 is here, and it's a great time to be a .NET developer.
Let's understand why.
