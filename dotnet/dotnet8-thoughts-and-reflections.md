# .NET 8 Thoughts and Reflections

.NET has been around for a while, going through different phases and transformations.
We could even say quite fairly that it has been gone through very deep transformations.

Inherently, developers, architects and companies might have experienced different feelings and thoughts about .NET.

What is the state of .NET today?

# .NET 8

.NET 8 is the current version of .NET.
It is now a cross platform framework. In the past, .NET Framework was tightly linked to Windows. However, since .NET Core, .NET is aiming different platforms.
After .NET 5, .NET Framework and .NET Core were merged and named .NET.

During the .NET Framework era, .NET built a very specific image and made part of the market/community quite reluctant to use it (closed-source, mono-platform, owned by Microsoft, proprietary tooling, etc). Without judging those opinions and that image, there were limitations despite the great value offered by the framework.

.NET has changed a lot since then. Now, it is cross-platform, open source, can easily be extended with third part libraries, is integrated with the community, there is free tooling besides the proprietary tooling, the learning curve is quite short, it offers answers to a enterprise/architectural/developer needs and a long etc.

However, it is still quite common to feel a certain level of reluctance to use .NET, from specific parts of the community. This post might be seen as an attempt of convincing to change their minds and use .NET. In fact, the main purpose is less opinionated and just sharing a perception, and, if it makes sense to the readers, try to assess and value .NET as it is today.

As an engineer, it is up to us to decide later if the use of .NET makes sense, could help our teams or be meaningful in the technical/business strategy of the company we work for.

# What does .NET 8 cover?

.NET 8 is a cross-platform framework that covers different scenarios, such as:
 - Web development (special mention to Blazor, the WASM framework that allows to build web applications with C#)
 - native and cross-platform mobile development (MAUI)
 - Desktop development (WPF, UWP, WinUI, MAUI) (not mentioning WinForms even though it seems still quite used)
 - Cloud development (APIs, Azure Functions, event/messages driven applications, data consuming applications, etc)
 - Machine learning
 - Game development
 - IoT development (IoT Operations, and IoT Solutions at cloud level)
 - API development (WebAPIs, CoreWCF, gRPC, etc)
 - Distributed applications (Aspire, Dapr, etc)
 - etc


# Aspects to reconsider about .NET 8

## Cross-platform

Yes, .NET is cross-platform. It is not only cross-platform, but also cross-architecture (x86, x64, ARM, etc).
There are parts of .NET like the UI related content where the cross-platform support is not complete. However, many other .NET features are cross-platform.

## Open source

Yes, .NET is opens source. This still surprises some people.

## Community

Yes, there is an important community around .NET contributing and enriching with rich content, libraries, tools, etc.

## Tooling

Tooling around .NET is probably among the best in the industry.
There are proprietary IDEs like Visual Studio, Rider, etc.

There are also free IDEs like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio Community, etc.

The same IDE is used for the different types of development.

Visual Studio, my personal choice for most of the tasks, is truly a great IDE:
 - the developer experience is quite good (IntelliSense, tools, extensions, performance analyzers, thread analyzers, etc)
 - the debugging experience is unique.
 - seamless integration with Azure, GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc (Git integration could be better though)
 

## Learning curve

.NET documentation and references are (or were) sometimes a mess.
The Learn Team is working to change this and it is becoming better.

There are a lot of free resources to start learning .NET and even, go deeper in specific topics.
There are also very good paid trainings from community members (ex: [https://dometrain.com](dometrain.com) from Nick Chapsas) or proffesionnal training services.

The features of .NET, how they have been implemented, their approach and how they are exposed to be used contains the learning effort to be done.

All these together builds a quite condensed learning curve.


## Enterprise/architectural/developer needs

Technical features and usability are one thing, but architectural/developer needs at enterprise level are another thing.
From this perspective, .NET and its whole ecosystem offer a good choice thanks to:
 - the maturity level
 - clear roadmaps (even though we all hate the speed of changes sometimes) guaranteed by a company like Microsoft
 - continuous improvements
 - reliability and stability
 - proprietary tooling that clearly improves the developer experience (coding, testing, efficiency, etc)
 - security patches and improvements
 - constant performance improvements
 - efficient support (different levels of support depending on the needs)
 - projection in time (long term support)
 - migration tools, guidance and support
 
 From the business perspective, .NET is good for the present and also for the future.


## Ecosystem

The size of the ecosystem is hard to assess. There are probably other ecosystems larger in volume.
This said, the .NET ecosystem is quite rich in terms of variety and volume (rich enough at least to avoid the closeness feeling).

That ecosystem relies on:
 - third editors
 - private companies
 - community
 - contributors (MVPs, RDs, other community members, etc)

## Business



## Performances



## EF8



## Blazor 8



## API developement



## MAUI 8



## Traces, logging, and debugging



## Containerization



## Distributed applications, Aspire



## Azure development



## Development experience


And without talking about all the Azure improvements (too long be exhaustive and precise), AI services, GitHub and Azure DevOps, etc.

Isn't it a great time to be a .NET developer?
Not only talking about the technology itself, but also the community and the ecosystem ... and also business.
From the business perspective, isn't .NET a great technical stack to invest in?


.NET 8 is here, and it's a great time to be a .NET developer.
Let's understand why.
