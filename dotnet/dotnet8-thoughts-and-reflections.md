# .NET 8 Thoughts and Reflections
# TODO

.NET has been around for a while, going through different phases and transformations.
We could even say quite fairly that it has been gone through very deep transformations.

Inherently, developers, architects and companies might have experienced different feelings and thoughts about .NET.

What is the state of .NET today?

# .NET 8



.NET 8 Improvements
Performances
Updated libraries and dependencies
API features (WebAPI, CoreWCf, gRPC)
EF8
Blazor 8
MAUI 8
Traces, logging, and debugging

General development experience (mainly for distributed applications)
Special mention to Aspire

Not only talking about the technology itself, but also the community and the ecosystem ... and also business.
From the business perspective, isn't .NET a great technical stack to invest in?


.NET 8 is here, and it's a great time to be a .NET developer.
Let's understand why.
