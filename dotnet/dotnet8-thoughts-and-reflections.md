# .NET 8 Thoughts and Reflections
# TODO

.NET has been around for a while, going through different phases and transformations.
We could even say quite fairly that it has been gone through very deep transformations.

Inherently, developers, architects and companies might have experienced different feelings and thoughts about .NET.

What is the state of .NET today?

# .NET 8

.NET 8 is the current version of .NET.
It is now a cross platform framework. In the past, .NET Framework was tightly linked to Windows. However, since .NET Core, .NET is aiming different platforms.
After .NET 5, .NET Framework and .NET Core were merged and named .NET.

During the .NET Framework era, .NET built a very specific image and made part of the market/community quite reluctant to use it (closed-source, mono-platform, owned by Microsoft, proprietary tooling, etc). Without judging those opinions and that image, there were limitations despite the great value offered by the framework.

.NET has changed a lot since then. Now, it is cross-platform, open source, can easily be extended with third part libraries, is integrated with the community, there is free tooling besides the proprietary tooling, the learning curve is quite short, it offers answers to a enterprise/architectural/developer needs and a long etc.

However, it is still quite common to feel a certain level of reluctance to use .NET, from specific parts of the community. This post might be seen as an attempt of convincing to change their minds and use .NET. In fact, the main purpose is less opinionated and just sharing a perpection, and, if it makes sense to the readers, try to assess and value .NET as it is today.

As an engineer, it is up to as to decide later if the use of .NET makes sense, could help our teams or be meaningful in the technical/business strategy of the company we work for.

And without talking about all the Azure improvements (too long be exhaustive and precise), AI services, GitHub and Azure DevOps, etc.

Isn't it a great time to be a .NET developer?
Not only talking about the technology itself, but also the community and the ecosystem ... and also business.
From the business perspective, isn't .NET a great technical stack to invest in?


.NET 8 is here, and it's a great time to be a .NET developer.
Let's understand why.
