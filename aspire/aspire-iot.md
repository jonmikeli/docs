# Aspire and IoT

Aspire has become way more than just a nice tool. Today it adds actual value when it comes to developing different types of applications through:
 - local monitoring
 - configuration definition and management
 - architecture definition and management
 - delivery

The variety of covered applications and languages makes Aspire a very versatile tool (not bound at .NET only).

Its native integration with GitHub Copilot is also very interesting when it comes to debugging.

Last but not least, its extensibility model and MCP server complete Aspire possibilities and contribute to its great popularity.

Obviously, it does not cover everything but the value created in terms of development experience is more than tangible.


# Why to use Aspire with IoT?

Some of the shared IoT Devices are shipped as containers. They are designed to be used through CLI either automatically or by hand.
However, from the develoment perspective, in some cases Aspire might be practical and offers a fast way to use the mentioned simulators.

Also, this might be an unusual use case, worth it being mentioned.


# Visual Studio and .NET CLI extensions
