# Docs, articles, posts and content of different types

This repository has for purpose to centralize part of the different types of contributions I have been doing in the last years.
Their number is increasing and they were starting to be dispersed. So, it was time to build a kind of hub where they could be all found.

This repository will evolve in time and be enriched iteration after iteration, either with documentation updates or new tools/libraries/publications.

The content is structured in many sections. For now, those identified are:
 - DevOps
 - dotnet
 - Iac
 - [IoT](./iot/iot-tools.md)
 - Azure (backend distributed applications with different types of persistence)

These sections might evolve with time.
