# Docs, articles, posts and content of different types

This repository has for purpose to centralize part of the different types of contributions I have been doing in the last years.
Their number is increasing and they were starting to be dispersed. So, it was time to build a kind of hub where they could be all found.

This repository will evolve in time and be enriched iteration after iteration, either with documentation updates or new tools/libraries/publications.

The content is structured in many sections. For now, those identified are:
 - [DevOps](./devops/README.md)
 - [dotnet](./dotnet/README.md)
 - [Iac](./iac/README.md)
 - [IoT](./iot/iot-tools.md)
 - [Azure](./azure/README.md) (backend distributed applications with different types of persistence)
 - Aspire
 - AI

These sections might evolve with time.
