# Cloud native solutions

Among the proposed templates, there different types of solutions:
 - .NET related solutions, with templates built to be containerized
 - Azure native templates

In both cases, the proposed extensions and templates are designed to help the developers to build Cloud Native solutions.

The next step would be to publish containers by default in a registry.
That way, the developers who do not need to customize the content provided by the extensions, will not need to use the extensions.
They could use the containers directly.
